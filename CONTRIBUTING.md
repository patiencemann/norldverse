## We Develop with Github

We use Github to validate and version code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation, currently using ```Postman```.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
